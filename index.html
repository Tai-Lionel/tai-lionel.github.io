              When I was a kid, I lived a very exciting life. As you are no
              doubt aware that our childhood is the happiest period of time when
              we don't have to think a lot. All we have to do is exploring the
              world, on other words, is figuring out which game is the most fun
              to play. I'm not an exception. I love the feeling when even the
              sunlight in the morning shining on my shoulder also makes me
              happy. In psychological term, it's called
              <em>sense of gerneral well-being</em>. It's kinda sorta like all
              of joy you had as a kid, a little thing in life would excite,
              mind-blow, and feel how beautiful everything around you

              Thinking of the period of time when I was in primary & secondary
              school. All I can remember is "study". I was an extremely good
              student, to be honest. If you get to return to the past and see
              what I was doing throughout the day, they would have to come down
              to a word "study". The reason why I was that diligent is that I
              had a thinking that I would make a lot of money by studying hard
              which is the stupiest thought I ever have back then

              This is me when I was studying in high school. Back then, I got my
              first smartphone thanks to the money that i was awarded when i was
              in grade 8. It was a turning point of my life. I had a chance to
              approach English and fall in love with it which have changed my
              ertire life. Besides, It screwed up my life as well. At that time,
              I was addicted to AOV and masturbation, I stayed up late every
              night to the point of 4am just to play that game and I had jerked
              off like for 3 times per day. Those things literally turned me
              into a zombie. On a daily basis I dozed off during like every
              sermon when I was in school. The consequence is that I failed to
              enter my wanted university.
